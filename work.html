               <h2> 30 tips for green livin’ </h2>
             June 2022
                  <p>
                       
                       I’ve been zero waste for almost a decade. 
This summer is among the hottest on record - makes sense after many years of bare-minimum environmental protection laws being lifter for years at this point. All of these are useful if you can help transition community spaces towards producing less landfill trash, together! I've learned individual efforts has been the most helpful in getting down and dirty in getting more acquanted with local consumers streams. Here are some quick and helpful ways to Reduce. Let’s jump right in:
<ol>
     <li> First, invite new habits by mentally shifting. Make it easy to remember why you do this, and how it can be improved. Maintaining knowledge about environmental topics has never been so easy! Include fun zero waste tiktoks, or Bloomberg articles. Knowledge is empowering. Having a news feed flooded with tidbits of education of the realities of climate chaos helps grounds us and reminds us how this work is improved 
          </li>

                  <h2> Morning Routine </h2> 
               
                  March 2021
<br><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/02/d0/15/02d0150c4bdbaeb2b0f461141aae74bc.jpg" alt="a picture of our house with Cannoli the cat sprinting away. The focal point is the white dining table with matching high chairs. There's a bookshelf with plants on top, and a wooden shelf with alcohol, a bird of paradise plant sits in the background with a large window behind it.">
                   
<br>
                 
<p> Mornings-- you can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em! They can be a wonderful tool to setting a standard for the rest of the day. Here are a few things I have found to be useful and realistic during Covid Times to help with some of the uncertainties and difficulties. Each is meant to be tweaked as the needs of each day arise. </p> 
     <ol>
<li> Recall and reflect on dream, take stock of your body and feelings, acknowledge what you’re going through. </li> 
<li> Make bed as an easy way to feel accomplished and have a neat place. </li> 
<li>  Open windows, let light and fresh air in if the weather permits. </li> 
<li>  Rehydrate with plain ol’ water and take morning supplements or medications. </li> 
<li> Splash cool water on face to wake up. </li> 
<li> Light stretch and a quick intense workout for a couple of minutes. </li> 
<li> Make tea and journal - include “to-feel” and “to-be” intentions to help you as a guide for the rest of the day. </li> 
<li> Make a to-do list that fits on a sticky note. I get a little carried away, this helps me keep it simple and realistic. </li> 
<li> Read a chapter or two of a book. </li> 
<li> Prepare or eat a nutritious meal to kick off the day! </li> 
     </ol>
                 
As the day progresses, take breaks often: 
     <ol>
<li> Online learning for a few minutes. So many great lessons out there!  </li> 
<li> Take a mental break! When things start stacking up, or when things feel overwhelming. This may be meditating or simply be lying down for a few minutes...</li>           
     </ol>
                  
Well, there you have it, folks. In short, take it easy, and strive towards progress.

         <ol>
  <li>I'm letting myself get fully immersed with books, magazines, media galore. And sweeten the deal by sipping a drink while listening to audiobooks or articles with the Pocket app. For shows: Living Single, Golden Girls, Pen15, and Ramy are some I recommend! </li>
<li> Informal deep breathing - No fancy app needed! Add an event on phone calendar that happens each evening, hourly, or any times that suits you. Opening windows and letting in fresh air helps breathing quality.  </li>
<li>Learning! new! skills! through Coursera.com, Lynda.com & Duolingo, and Mango for Hindi & Russian, gaining design insights, and even learn to play this ukulele my friend got me one of these weeks! </li>
<li>Ordering in from local places that need support - to-go orders sans extra packaging like plastic utensils and bringing our own bags  - even cutting down on paper bags may not save the trees, but can be keeping unnecessary trash out of our home. </li>
<li> Volunteering with lots of inter-generational groups with groovy activities, like weekly chats, informational talks about politics, health, and so on.</li>
<li> Cannoli, the kitty - he loves attention so it works out beautifully. </li>
<li>DIY spa treatments :) I’m making lots of hair and face masks! </li>
<li>Therapy over zoom with a disabled therapist - what a world of difference it makes to be understood! They know how to properly challenge me. </li>
<li> Walks in the neighborhood - to get Buy Nothing stuff, get fresh air, scenery, and for joyful movements. </li>
<li> Gardening - both indoor and outdoor. I plucked my first peppers and looking forward to keep learning. Honestly though, baffling how farmers do it year round! </li>
<li> Writing - I’m writing again! Poetry is cathartic and I'm starting to put words to paper for the first time since my high school's chapbook. </li>
</ol> 
Well, that's that about that. Hopefully this list reminds that there's much wonder and beauty in the world. And how we use our time to idle and recharge is just as important as advancing and growing.

    <br><br>
  <div>
      Alas, I’ve returned, above are some pictures & some thoughts:
    <p>
        Norway is a lot like Texas — independence is a mood. We both love our autonomy, open wide spaces, and oil money.
       This autonomy can also mean lacking crucial aid for disabled people and giving us ready-made choices like non-disabled people have. For example:
            Transit was a long haul in this long country, and was made unpredictable to me as a wheelchair user – some long-distance buses didn't have ramps or lifts; and here's the kicker…
            Norwegian Airlines put the responsibilty of calling ahead and insuring a step-free entrance onto the wheelchair users to get a plane we can board, instead of having universal design. One of the reasons I came was to check out the beautiful and functional Scandinavians design.

       <p> Entrances often had colossal steps to enter, and I repeatedly had to make (literal!) noise outside the building to get attention from people inside, only to then be led inside through back entrances in order to enter restaurants and shops – gladly people were happy to oblige. </p>

       <p> One night, we couldn’t find a hotel in Oslo that had a working lift, and the hostel workers repeatedly delayed helping us. This felt no different than the occasional incident in the States.
    </p><p>
       Okay, on the great parts: Norway was fashionable, everyone was sporting well-fitting, classic ensembles, solid smartly-paired colors, and warm, minimalist attire I so badly craved. Of course, they reflected the homogeneous values. I felt like a goofy toddler for wearing a multi-color hat…
        Norway is nippier than I anticipated. Somehow the Texas heat erased all memory of just how cold the weather can get. I struggled to find a jacket in Trondheim, thus the unhappy camper in the picture above.
        Another great tid bit: I saw many wheelchair users! When people watching from a corner cafe safely nestled in the warm inside, we saw so many wheelchair users out and about using heavy-duty scooters and wheels. It was refreshing to see my people in such large numbers!
        Ola Schrøder Røyset, our lovely host and local celebrity, showed us the swanky spots around town. Getting to know him was a delight. Confirming my research, hearing gossip, chasing down the Northern Lights, and learning the local lore was absolutely worth coming for.

       A few mentionables: viking museum opened up my eyes to a whole culture, unlike any other. The Munch Scream was pretty moving, especially after learning about the artist's mental health. Seeing bundled up youth reminded me so much of SKAM characters! The government-funded Teslas populating the streets!
         <p/><p>
        However, I am sad that I wasn't able to yet fulfil my carefully selected to-do items for optimal cultural sampling that included: black metal concert, fashion show, thriffting clothes & furniture (maybe to move in?), Oslo statue museum/ Frogner Park, fjords, Bergan fishing market/ boating life, finucular rainway for the views, Oslo City Hall (peek at that working class mural!), cabin camping, etc etc

    Aaron’s reflections, and I quote:

        <li>   "The food!</li>
          <li> The fishballs!  </li>
        <li>   Getting sick! </li>
      <li>     Taking the bus! </li>
      <li>     'Where are the dogs?' </li>
      <li>     Supermarkets! </li>
      <li>     Cathedral drive-by! </li>
      <li>     Crazy architecture hotel" </li>
    </p><p>
       All in all, I was glad to return to the States after such a hectic week. We still have much to learn about each other. 😉

       Until the next visit, I'll be listening to the Norway Top 50 on Spotify, and watching Norsemen on Netflix.
