<p> <h2>  12 Things Keeping Me Sane</h2> September 2020
         <ol>
  <li>I'm letting myself be distracted fully with books, magazines, media galore - sweeten the deal by sipping a drink while reading audiobooks or articles with the Pocket app. You're reading right now! What a great start. Living Single, Golden Girls, Pen15, are Ramy are some shows I recommend. </li>
      <li> Informal deep breathing - I used an app but decided to add an event on phone calendar that happens each evening instead to loosen up my phone storage. Opening windows and letting in fresh air helps! 
</li>
      <li>Learning! new! skills! through Coursera.com, Lynda.com & duolingo, Mango for Hindi & Russian, gaining design insights, and even learn to play this ukulele my friend got me
</li>
  <li>Ordering in from local places that need support - to-go orders sans extra packaging like plastic utensils and bringing our own bags  - even cutting down on paper bags can be keeping unnecessary trash out of our home. 
</li>
  <li> Volunteering with lots of inter-generational groups with groovy activities! 
</li>
  <li> Cannoli, the kitty - he loves attention so it works out beautifully. 
</li>
  <li>DIY spa treatments :) I’m using lots of hair and face masks up finally!  
</li>
  <li>Therapy over zoom with a fellow disabled person - what a world of difference it makes to not have to crip-splain. 
</li>
  <li> Walks in the neighborhood - to get Buy Nothing stuff, get fresh air, scenery, and sometimes to have joyful movement
</li>
  <li> Gardening - indoor and outdoor - plucked my first peppers and looking forward to keep learning. Honestly, I don’t know how farmers do it! 
</li>
  <li> Paying reparations, need I say more? 
</li>
  <li> Writing - I’m writing again! Poetry is cathartic and I'm starting to put word sto paper for the first time since my high school's chapbook assignment. 
</li>
    
</ol> 
         </p>

       <div>
      Alas, I’ve returned, above are some pictures, & here are thoughts:
    <p>
        Norway is a lot like Texas — independence is a mood. We both love our autonomy, open wide spaces, and oil money.
       This autonomy can also mean lacking crucial aid for disabled people and giving us ready-made choices like non-disabled people have. For example:
            Transit was a long haul in this long country, and was made unpredictable to me as a wheelchair user – some long-distance buses didn't have ramps or lifts; and here's the kicker…
            Norwegian Airlines put the responsibilty of calling ahead and insuring a step-free entrance onto the wheelchair users to get a plane we can board, instead of having universal design (aren’t Scandinavians pioneers in beautiful + functional design?)

       <p> Entrances often had colossal steps to enter, and I repeatedly had to make (literal!) noise outside the building to get attention from people inside, only to then be led inside through back entrances in order to enter restaurants and shops – gladly people were happy to oblige. </p>

       <p> One night, we couldn’t find a hotel in Oslo that had a working lift, and the hostel workers repeatedly delayed helping us. This felt no different than the occasional incident in the States.
    </p><p>
       Okay, on the great parts: Norway was fashionable, everyone was sporting well-fitting, classic ensembles, solid smartly-paired colors, and warm, minimalist attire I so badly craved. Of course, they reflected the homogeneous values. I felt like a goofy toddler for wearing a multi-color hat…
        Norway is nippier than I anticipated. Somehow the Texas heat erased all memory of just how cold the weather can get. I struggled to find a jacket in Trondheim, thus the unhappy camper in the picture above.
        Another great tid bit: I saw many wheelchair users! When people watching from a corner cafe safely nestled in the warm inside, we saw so many wheelchair users out and about using heavy-duty scooters and wheels. It was refreshing to see my people in such large numbers!
        Ola Schrøder Røyset, our lovely host and local celebrity, showed us the swanky spots around town. Getting to know him was a delight. Confirming my research, hearing gossip, chasing down the Northern Lights, and learning the local lore was absolutely worth coming for.
      <p/><p>
       A few mentionables: viking museum opened up my eyes to a whole culture, unlike any other. The Munch Scream was pretty moving, especially after learning about the artist's mental health. Seeing bundled up youth reminded me so much of SKAM characters! The government-funded Teslas populating the streets!
         <p/><p>
        However, I am sad that I wasn't able to yet fulfil my carefully selected to-do items for optimal cultural sampling that included: black metal concert, fashion show, thriffting clothes & furniture (maybe to move in?), Oslo statue museum/ Frogner Park, fjords, Bergan fishing market/ boating life, finucular rainway for the views, Oslo City Hall (peek at that working class mural!), cabin camping, etc etc
    </p><p>
    Aaron’s reflections, and I quote:

        <li>   "The food!</li>
          <li> The fishballs!  </li>
        <li>   Getting sick! </li>
      <li>     Taking the bus! </li>
      <li>     'Where are the dogs?' </li>
      <li>     Supermarkets! </li>
      <li>     Cathedral drive-by! </li>
      <li>     Crazy architecture hotel" </li>
    </p><p>
